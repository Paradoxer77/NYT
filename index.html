        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
        new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
        beyond the world of known physics.
      </p>
      <!-- </div> -->

      <p class="news">
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in the
        Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the
        presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
        repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
        instant.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big
        Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="description">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
        with
        telescopes at the South Pole, a
        team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in
        the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="description">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of
        a
        universe being wrenched violently
        apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
        smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it
        could ever be proved.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark
        energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and
        energy to science and speculation.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
        hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
        and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
        bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
      </p>

      <p class="focus">‘As Big as It Gets’</p>

      <p class="news">
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach
        of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the
        first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
        should ruffle space-time.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
        “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
        waves.”
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space
        and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
        Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here
        on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p></p>

      <p class="news">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
      <p class="news">
        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
        confirmation in his lifetime.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing
        email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
        Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
        that night in 1979), in his office last week.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
        words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
      </p>

      <p class="news">
        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known
        as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a
        Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="#" class="description">knocked on his door with a
          bottle of
          Champagne</a> to tell him
        the news.
